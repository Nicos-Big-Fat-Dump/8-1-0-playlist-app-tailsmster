# 8-1-0-playlist-app
The homework this week will be a little bit different. It will be more similar to a solo project! To get started, create a new repo on your account called 810-playlist-app. You will submit the link to the repo on canvas (it will be posted shortly).Your homework this week is listed at “Challenge” section at the bottom of this Notes Repository
Links to an external site., but here is a quick overview:

    You will be tasked with creating a frontend and backend app that lets users manage a playlist of songs
    The frontend will display the songs and let users create new songs and update/delete existing songs
    The backend will store the songs data, serve the frontend code, and provide API endpoints for manipulating the songs data

This is due on Friday morning at 10am but you will need to have the following checkpoints completed:

    By Tuesday 10am — create the repo and set up the app structure. Copy from the repo above!
    By Wednesday 10am — your server should have a fully functional backend with a model, controllers, and endpoints for performing the 5 CRUD operations: Get All, Get One, Create, Update, Delete
    By Friday 10am — your frontend should be able to make these requests to the backend and render the songs in a list

Remember, a server application is mostly “boilerplate” (it’s the same every time) so feel free to copy the example applications in the notes and refactor them to suit your needs. Refactoring is the real challenge here, not creating from scratch.
